# CodeSnippetSearcher
Searches for your currently selected text on Google, Github and Stackoverflow.

## It Will
- Sanitise the selected text by removing punctuation, and preparing it for search on Google, Github and Stackoverflow
- Open Google, Github and Stackoverflow in separate tabs in Google Chrome with the sanitised text
- Perform an additional google search with "What does " `your selected text` " do?"
- Open all URLs in Google Chrome


## Installation
- Inspect the file!  Never run anything without knowing what it does ;)
- save the _Open_help_pages_from_snippet.workflow_ file locally, and open with Apple Automator
- Select `File>save` and save to your local services, typically in icloud
- Go to `System Preferences>Keyboard>Shortcuts>Services` and select the _Open_help_pages_from_snippet_ service
- Assign a keyboard shortcut, I use <kbd>Ctrl + Alt + Cmnd + H</kdb>
